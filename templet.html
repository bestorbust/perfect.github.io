                <p>In 1867, when Mendeleev began writing
                     Principles of Chemistry, he set out 
                     to organize and explain the elements. 
                     He began with what he called the “typical” 
                     elements: hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon.
                      Those substances demonstrated a natural order for
                       themselves. Next he included the halogens, which
                        had low atomic weights, reacted easily with other
                         elements, and were readily available in nature. He
                          had begun by using atomic weights as a principle of
                           organization, but these alone did not present a clear system.</p>
